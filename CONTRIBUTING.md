## Contributing

Naturally, you'll need Composer installed and running.

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Install the dependencies
4. Run the tests
5. Browse tests for more usage.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mateu-aguilo-bosch/mpx-php
composer install
composer test
```

When you've got a patch ready, make sure the tests still pass, and try to write a new test that covers your change.
